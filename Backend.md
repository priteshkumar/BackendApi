## Web Services

### Adavantages of decoupled layered web app(data/backend logic/ui) via API

> Makes website scalable. Create ui for different form-factors(tablet/smartphone) without changing backend/database.

> Reduce codebase for all form factors (maintainable code)

> Making changes in api allows modification of webapp easy.


### Api Advantages

> It helps you make the data accessible across different services

> It helps you access data for the same service, across multiple platforms such as mobile apps, websites, etc.

> It helps you scale your service or application by having  different APIs on different servers

> It allows you to update the backend without changing the front end


### Web Service

> It is an interoperable software system designed to support machine-to-machine interaction over a network.



### Webservice Api development 

> The requirements and business goals for a specific endpoint are laid down by the product manager in the form of a JSON file, based on which the endpoints are then to be defined and implemented by the backend developer. 

> The JSON file consists of all the details defined for an endpoint such as endpoint definition, required inputs and the corresponding response messages etc., this helps the developer to create the endpoint.
